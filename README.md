# Entertainment Rental Shop

The system being developed, will be used for a rental store that allows
employees to loan out items. These loaned items will then be returned to the
store after use by the public, and they can be tracked to see overdue fees and
who currently has the item.
This system will have a fully functional GUI that’ll allow for search capabilities
(to see item availability and details) and a login page that the user will have to
pass before entering the system, this will also be used by employees of the store
(not the public) that can register other users, but only the admin can approve
this, the admin can also reset passwords, unlock accounts and delete users.
Furthermore, the system will allow for different items (books, DVDs, CDs, and
Audiobooks) to be catalogued within the database. In addition to these, each
item will have different options (for example, CDs will have their genre).
Other features of the system will include a monthly report that'll show the user
the most popular item, the number of times each item has been loaned and
returned, and the total of items that have been landed and returned.</br>
